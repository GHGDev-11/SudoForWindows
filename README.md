# SudoForWindows
Welcome to SudoFW!\
If you run Windows but need to run a sudo command from linux, you can use SudoFW!\
After running the SudoFW installer, you will be able to run the sudo command **only if you are in the C:\Program Files (x86)\SudoFW directory.\
To be able to run the sudo command from any directory, run `SudoToPath.exe`.\
\
To test if the installation went successful, run a sudo command of your choice by opening cmd and typing:
```
sudo [Your command here]
```
Good luck using SudoFW!
